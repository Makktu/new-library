# ANOTHER GO AT THE ODIN PROJECT LIBRARY APP

My first effort ended up like so much twisted spaghetti. And was so full of bugs. It would have taken longer to fix (and make it look nice) than to start again from scratch, avoiding the mistakes of the first attempt.

One of the main objects of this is to learn more about JS Objects and Prototypes, so I will be paying attention to that as well.

13-Aug-2021: Got the Edit function working, but my solution is terrible. 'Making it work' through artifical brute force instead of writing proper clean code.

17 Aug 2021: THE THIRD ATTEMPT (and final one). New branch.

18 Aug 2021: Done it! Completed all the required parts of the project. None of the bonus credit features, but everything else...

-   Create a new book
-   a button to delete it
-   a button to toggle its Read status

....exists.

22-Aug-2021: the display is wonky on some browsers/devices. Doh. I won't backtrack to fix this now, for this project, but will strive to avoid the issue(s) in future projects.
